Spring...D'oh!
==============

Brain-dead app to get a feel of developing with [Spring 4][spring].
Some background reading material: chapters 1 through 4 and chapter 21 of [Spring
in Action][spring-in-action]. (Or whatever other intro you fancy.)

Use `gradlew <task>` (Unix; `gradlew.bat` for Windows) to build, test, run, etc.
This lists all available build tasks:

    ./gradlew tasks

Using Eclipse? You can generate all project files with:

    ./gradlew eclipse

then just import the project into Eclipse; alternatively if you have the Gradle 
Eclipse plugin (Buildship), you could instead run: 

    ./gradlew build
 
then import into Eclipse as a Gradle project.
